<h2>What causes&nbsp;<a href="https://civilappraisal.com/causes-of-cracks-in-brick-walls/">brick house cracks</a></h2>
<h3>Soil subsidence</h3>
<p>It all starts with the construction of the house. To place the foundations of a building, soil excavation has been done. With time the ground settles down, and the foundation of the house moves a little. This movement can cause small vertical cracks, often not a problem.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of soil that your house is built upon, your house may experience more drastic movement, that can damage the house significantly.</p>
<p>Natural disasters like earthquakes, floods and hurricanes can damage the foundation of your house significantly.</p>
<h3>Climate and seasonal changes</h3>
<p>The materials that our houses are built with respond quite a lot to the climate conditions and seasonal changes. Rain and water can damage both the walls and foundations, as well as long periods of drought.</p>
<h3>Corrosion and deterioration of building materials</h3>
<p>Building materials don&rsquo;t last forever. Weather, gravity and bad maintenance impact our structures constantly.</p>
<p>The building reinforcement is prone to corrosion, especially if the concrete foundation is not done properly. Cracks in the foundations, expose the steel reinforcement to moisture which can cause rusting and may lead to brick wall cracks.</p>
<h3>Construction works in your area</h3>
<p>If you live close to a construction site, this can affect the brick walls. The vibration from the regular use of heavy machines, excavation, digging etc may cause your brick walls to crack.</p>
<h3>Reactive soils in your area</h3>
<p>Some types of soils, such as clay, are reactive to moisture because it expands when moist and cracks and shrinks when dry.</p>
<p>If your house is built on clay soil, this reaction may cause it to move slightly and cause the appearance of small wall cracks.</p>
<p>Luckily, in most cases, these types of cracks are only cosmetic and can be fixed easily. If the cracks are wider than 3 mm and grow over time, you should take the problem seriously and call a professional to inspect your property.</p>
<h3>Trees close to the house</h3>
<p>Big trees close to your house can contribute to brick wall cracking. Their root structures are invasive and can damage the foundation of your house. They also need a lot of water, thus can affect the moisture in the soil.</p>
<p>As we mentioned above, dry soil can also cause wall cracks.</p>
